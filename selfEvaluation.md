# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
 - I feel relatively confident in the process of getting the correct coding and phrasing for for statements. Something about these are clicking better with me than previous lessons.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- Knowing I have to look for outside resources makes me feel more comfortable. I do not have much/any background knowledge so I did a good amount of looking things up to figure out what I needed. The entire process I felt was a productive struggle. I did not find myself having to stop or step away from the work to complete for the first assignment in a while.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
-Honestly, everything. I want to become fluent in these exercises and challenges without having doubts. I do need to adjust my calendar, and have already started to. I just need more time with everything.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
-I had one specific question that I asked in our small group channel in slack.
